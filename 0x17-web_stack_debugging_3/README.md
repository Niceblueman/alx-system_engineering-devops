# Troubleshooting Apache 500 Error Deployment

This repository contains a solution for troubleshooting and resolving an Apache 500 error using strace, along with an automated deployment using Puppet. The process involves analyzing the system calls made by the Apache server to pinpoint the root cause of the error and subsequently automating the solution using Puppet configuration management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Puppet](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_index.html)
- [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/)

## Getting Started

To get started with the troubleshooting and deployment process, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Analyze with strace

- Use `strace` to attach to the running Apache process and analyze the system calls.
- Run `tmux` to enable simultaneous monitoring with `strace` and `curl` in separate windows.

### Step 2: Identify the Issue

- Identify the root cause of the Apache 500 error using the data obtained from the `strace` analysis.

### Step 3: Implement the Fix

- Create a Puppet module to implement the necessary changes identified during the troubleshooting phase.
- Utilize appropriate Puppet resource types within the `0-strace_is_your_friend.pp` file for implementing the fix.

### Step 4: Automated Deployment

- Use Puppet to automate the deployment of the solution.
- Ensure that the Puppet manifests and configurations are correctly applied to the target system.

## File Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```
|- README.md
|- 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
|- /scripts
    |- analyze.sh
    |- deploy.sh
|- /strace_logs
    |- apache_trace.log
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the provided files:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `analyze.sh` script to initiate the strace analysis.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the script and the README to identify and resolve the Apache 500 error.
4. Use the `deploy.sh` script or Puppet directly to apply the fix to the target system.
